##Creating Repository

#What is .git?

A folder automatically created once a git repository is initialized using "git init". It's a hidden folder (starts with .) and contains all the necessary information to help git do its job (track changes, manage history, etc.).

#What is the status of an added file?

The file is now ready to be commited, therefore it's marked as modified by git and is now in the staging area.
